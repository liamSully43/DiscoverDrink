# Discover Drink

## Purpose
This is a back-up copy of the code used to build the Discover Drink project. The current [live version](http://discoverdrink.org/) is the old version of the project built with Node.js, this version is/will be built with PHP & MySQL. This project will help me to practice using PHP & to learn how to use MySQL.

## Features
 - PHP Router
 - Home page
 - Search page
 - Drinks page
 - Bars page
 - 404 page

## Known Issues
Unable to access IONOS SQL server using PHP - The permissions settings are too strict and cannot be changed. Oracle offer a free SQL database service which uses REST APIs, this will be used instead.

## Notes
None
